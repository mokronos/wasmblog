The only case where human knowledge might help a bit is when you have a product that is not working without a lot of data and that data is only obtainable during operation, for example self driving cars.
Then, it might be helpful to develop a lower capability system with the help of human knowledge to have a sellable system and get the data to train the system from scratch without human knowledge (e.g. Tesla FSD)</p>

## Destiny notes

- Website to organize Destiny's arguments in a nice format with logic structure
- link to segments/proofs

### overarching points

- All the points are supposed to be examples of the application of a system
- This system is used to generate good outcomes in your live
- So don't try to copy the outcome of the points, as they are based on Destiny's subjective values and environment
- Instead try to understand the system and apply it to your own life

###
- Act as a sounding board when talking with emotional friend
- if you have the choice between burning someone to the ground or leaving it neutral, leave it neutral
- be really careful when comparing people, especially when both are friends
    - e.g. Comparing body parts


## AI vs human

- Website with question
- need to select real answer, from real and AI generated answer
- AI generated answer is instructed to sound like human (gpt3 api)

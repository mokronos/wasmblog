# Artificial Intelligence

## General
[General methods](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) are almost always better than imposing human knowledge on the system (e.g. Alpha Go Zero, Image Processing with edges vs deep learning).
The only case where human knowledge might help a bit is when you have a product that is not working without a lot of data and that data is only obtainable during operation, for example self driving cars.
Then, it might be helpful to develop a lower capability system with the help of human knowledge to have a sellable system and get the data to train the system from scratch without human knowledge (e.g. Tesla FSD)

<h1>Just some tips for habits</h1>
<h2>Don't multitask</h2>
<p>It just doesn't work, you think it works, but it doesn't. You're just switching between tasks, and you're not doing any of them well. Or you are doing one with 80% of your brain and the other 20%, so the one with 20% isn't even enjoyed, so why not do it with 100% of your brain in your free time.</p>
<h2>Social media/ entertainment</h2>
<p>Only watch them while eating or in free time. Then you can watch the highlights of the day, and not needing to search for cool stuff while you should be working or doing other things.</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>Keep sleep schedule, wake up early, try 8h.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Mix running and at home exercise, depending on weather and state of mind. Don't miss two days in a row. Its easy to lose the habit then.</p>
<h2>Eat healthy</h2>
<p>Just count your calories, and eat filling foods. Mix it up, change some vegetables, proteins and spices in the recipes, mix up rice with noodles or lentils.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Eliminate distractions. Block websites like YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, etc. Work for selected periods of time, but focused.</p>
<h2>Do your bed</h2>
<p>Yeah, sounds like the meme daddy Peterson tells you, but it helps, its a small task that's easy to accomplish, and it makes you feel good. It's a good habit to start with.</p>
<h2>Shower</h2>
<p>Just shower early in morning, makes you feel fresh and ready for the day. And wear clothes that you would wear in public or work. Makes you feel ready.</p>
<h2>Walks</h2>
<p>Take a walk without any distractions. No phone, just enjoy the nature. It's good for your mind and body. It may sound stupid, but it will make you feel better.</p>
<h2>ToDo list</h2>
<p>Don't put too many tasks on there, and make them as small as possible. That way, you can actually achieve them, and don't feel bad because you only managed to complete half of them by the end of the day.</p>
<h2>Free time</h2>
<p>You need some dedicated time to do whatever you want. If not, it will creep into the time you should be working.</p>
<p>Good time to socialize. Meeting friends helps.</p>
